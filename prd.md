### Database Schema (Minimal)

```
USERS (Managed by Better Auth)
‚îú‚îÄ id: uuid
‚îú‚îÄ name: string
‚îú‚îÄ email: string (unique)
‚îú‚îÄ image: string (avatar URL)
‚îî‚îÄ created_at: timestamp

HABITS (Custom)
‚îú‚îÄ id: uuid
‚îú‚îÄ user_id: uuid (FK ‚Üí USERS)
‚îú‚îÄ name: string (required, 3-50 chars)
‚îú‚îÄ description: string (optional, max 200 chars)
‚îú‚îÄ created_at: timestamp
‚îî‚îÄ active: boolean
